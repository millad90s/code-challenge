if you have python3 then run this code for example in linux command line: 
python3 main.py -l 1 2 3 4 5 6. 
This code says: give list of even and odd numbers from 1 to 6 separately. 
Note:but If you don't have Python 3, then you don't need to type the number 3 for it. Just write the command without the number 3
